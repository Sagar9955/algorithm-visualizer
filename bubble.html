      <h4>Bubble Sort</h4>
      <p>
        Bubble Sort is a simple yet effective sorting algorithm. Here’s a
        detailed explanation: How it Works: Bubble Sort works by repeatedly
        stepping through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if
        they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until
        the list is sorted. The algorithm gets its name from the way smaller
        elements “bubble” to the top of the list. Algorithm: In Bubble Sort
        algorithm, we traverse from left and compare adjacent elements and the
        higher one is placed at right side. In this way, the largest element is
        moved to the rightmost end at first. This process is then continued to
        find the second largest and place it and so on until the data is sorted.
      </p>
      <p>Here’s a step-by-step explanation:</p>
      <li>
        Step 1: Compare the first and the second element of the list. If the
        first element is greater than the second element, swap them.
      </li>
      <li>
        Step 2: Move to the next pair of elements, compare their values and swap
        them if required. This step is repeated until the end of the list.
      </li>
      <li>
        Step 3: At this point, the highest value in the list would have bubbled
        up to the end of the list. Repeat the steps 1 and 2 for the rest of the
        list (i.e., the first n-1 elements).
      </li>
      <li>Step 4: Repeat steps 1 to 3 until no more swaps are needed.</li>
      <h4>Complexity</h4>
      <p>Time Complexity:</p>

      <li>
        Best Case: The best case occurs when the array is already sorted. In
        this case, the time complexity is O(N), where N is the number of
        elements in the array.
      </li>
      <li>
        Worst Case: The worst case occurs when the array is sorted in reverse
        order. In this case, the time complexity is O(N²).
      </li>
      <li>
        Average Case: On average, Bubble Sort has a time complexity of O(N²),
        regardless of the arrangement of elements in the input array.
      </li>
      <p>Space Complexity:</p>
      <p>
        Bubble Sort is an in-place sorting algorithm, meaning it doesn’t require
        additional memory to perform the sorting. Hence, its space complexity is
        O(1).
      </p>
      <h4>Advantages</h4>
      <li>Bubble sort is easy to understand and implement.</li>
      <li>It does not require any additional memory space.</li>
      <li>
        It is a stable sorting algorithm, meaning that elements with the same
        key value maintain their relative order in the sorted output
      </li>
      <h4>Disadvantages:</h4>
      <li>
        Bubble sort has a time complexity of O(n²) which makes it very slow for
        large data sets.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bubble sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm, which means that it
        requires a comparison operator to determine the relative order of
        elements in the input data set. It can limit the efficiency of the
        algorithm in certain cases.
